This is a repository for self tracking my progress learning python
This project was started in 2021-August-01 Sunday
The book I am using is 'Learn python the hard way'
During the first two day of self studying I learned how to use Windows Terminal
and then the second day I followed a YouTube video and learned to use Git and
Github to track my project

I will follow the book and do all the exercises and they will appear here as well
